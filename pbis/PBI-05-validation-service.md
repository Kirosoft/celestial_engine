## Goal
Central validator for node props and full node objects.

## Description
Initialize AJV with options; compile each node schema; provide `validateNode(node)` returning `{ valid, errors? }`.

## Business Value
Guarantees structural integrity and consistent failure messaging.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Invalid props blocked at create/update (400)
- Errors formatted (path, message)
- Validate 100 nodes < 50ms warm

## Definition of Done
- Unit tests covering valid & invalid samples

## Implementation Checklist
- [x] AJV instance initialization
- [x] Compile all node schemas on load
- [x] validateNode function + error normalization
- [ ] Performance benchmark script (deferred)
- [x] Integration with NodeRepo create/update

## Test Cases
1. Valid node passes (returns valid=true)
2. Missing required prop fails with path
3. Additional property removal (if configured) enforced
4. Performance test under threshold

## Risks / Notes
Command validation added in later phase. Validator exercised in unit, integration, and e2e tests (see `TESTING.md`).

## Implementation Status
AJV service compiles all node schemas once; validateNode integrated into NodeRepo create/update and API routes. Error normalization returns path + message arrays matching acceptance criteria. Performance acceptable for current scale (no measured regression observed).

### Verified By
- Unit tests: valid/invalid samples
- Playwright: validation error scenarios (missing required field) returning structured errors
- Integration tests referencing apiErrors mapping

### Current Gaps / Tech Debt
- Performance benchmark script (deferred) not yet implemented
- No caching of compiled validators across potential worker processes (single-process only)
- Lacks schema version mismatch diagnostics (future command schema phase)

## Outstanding / Deferred
- Implement benchmark script capturing validate throughput (baseline for future optimization)
- Add instrumentation (avg validation ms, error rates)
- Extend to command/action schemas in Phase 2
