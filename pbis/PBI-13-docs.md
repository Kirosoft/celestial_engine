## Goal
Document repositories, schemas layout, and lifecycle examples.

## Description
Create `docs/architecture/phase1.md` or README section describing NodeRepo, Edge management, index, schemas, and APIs.

## Business Value
Onboarding efficiency and consistent contributor guidance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Covers file layout & example node JSON
- Up-to-date with implemented endpoints
- No TODO placeholders

## Definition of Done
- Internal review sign-off

## Implementation Checklist
- [x] Initial testing guide (`TESTING.md`)
- [ ] Draft architecture document
- [ ] Include file layout diagram
- [ ] Include example node JSON
- [ ] Section on schemas & validation
- [ ] Section on error handling
- [ ] Review + revision pass

## Test Cases
1. All PBIs referenced in doc
2. README cross-links docs
3. No TODO placeholders remain

## Risks / Notes
May evolve into a docs site later. Testing documentation underway (see `TESTING.md`).

## Implementation Status
Initial testing guide present. Core architectural documentation pending (sections for repos, schemas, error handling not yet drafted). PBIs now annotated with Implementation Status & Outstanding sections to feed into architecture doc content.

### Verified By
- Presence of `TESTING.md`
- Updated PBIs 01–12 with status annotations (serves as source material)

### Current Gaps / Tech Debt
- Missing architecture overview & diagrams
- No schema catalog with examples
- No cross-linking from README to deeper docs

## Outstanding / Deferred
- Draft `docs/architecture/phase1.md` including repository diagram
- Add schema reference table (type → description → file path)
- Incorporate error model section referencing PBI-12
- Update README with quick links to architecture & testing docs
