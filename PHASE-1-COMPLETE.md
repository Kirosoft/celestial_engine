# Phase 1 Complete - MVP 0.1

**Completion Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Stable baseline established

---

## Overview

Phase 1 establishes the foundational graph execution engine with a clean separation between:
- File-based node/edge persistence
- Schema-driven validation
- Execution orchestration with buffering & middleware
- Basic UI canvas with node manipulation

---

## Core Architecture Delivered

### 1. Storage Layer (`lib/fileRepo.ts`, `lib/nodeRepo.ts`)
- ✅ Atomic writes via temp-file + rename pattern
- ✅ Path safety validation (prevents traversal attacks)
- ✅ JSON node/edge persistence in `nodes/` and `groups/`
- ✅ Defensive temp file filtering (`.tmp-*` exclusion)
- ✅ Graph integrity guards (dangling edge cleanup)

### 2. Schema & Validation (`lib/schemaLoader.ts`, `lib/validator.ts`)
- ✅ JSON Schema-based node type definitions
- ✅ Runtime validation with AJV
- ✅ Default props injection per schema
- ✅ Schema versioning foundation
- ✅ Supported node types: Task, Code, LLM, ChatNode, LogNode, FileReaderNode, Group

### 3. Execution Engine (`lib/execution/`, `lib/execution.ts`)
- ✅ Emission queue with middleware pipeline
- ✅ Input buffering with window/reduce/since semantics (`bufferStore.ts`)
- ✅ Capability registry (autoExecuteOnInput, logsInputs, receivesHistory) (`capabilityRegistry.ts`)
- ✅ History middleware (appends execution context to downstream nodes)
- ✅ Log middleware (structured log entry creation with classification)
- ✅ Variable mapping helper for LLM nodes (`varMapping.ts`)
- ✅ Cold pull support (FileReaderNode, ChatNode, LogNode content on-demand)
- ✅ Diagnostic emission (cold_pull_*, implicit_var_mapping_added, etc.)
- ✅ LLM provider abstraction (OpenAI, Ollama, Anthropic detection)
- ✅ Prompt template rendering with Mustache-style variables

### 4. Node Types Implemented
| Type | Purpose | Key Features |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Task** | Planning/checklist | Basic text container |
| **Code** | Code snippets | Language tagging |
| **LLM** | AI completion | Multi-provider, prompt templates, variable injection |
| **ChatNode** | User input | Manual message emission |
| **LogNode** | Execution log viewer | History filtering, maxEntries, resize, clear |
| **FileReaderNode** | File I/O | Single file / directory scan, emit on action |
| **Group** | Subgraph container | Proxy nodes, isolated edge routing |

### 5. UI Components (`apps/web/components/`)
- ✅ Canvas with ReactFlow integration (`Canvas.tsx`)
- ✅ Node drag & position persistence
- ✅ Edge creation via drag & click
- ✅ Inspector panel with schema-driven forms (`Inspector.tsx`)
- ✅ Toolbox for node creation (`Toolbox.tsx`)
- ✅ Custom node renderers (ChatNode, LogNode, FileReaderNode)
- ✅ Group expansion/navigation (subgraph view)
- ✅ Delete guards (prevent accidental LogNode deletion)
- ✅ System settings panel (API keys, Ollama config)
- ✅ File explorer for FileReaderNode path selection

### 6. API Endpoints (`apps/web/pages/api/`)
- ✅ `/api/nodes` - CRUD operations
- ✅ `/api/nodes/[id]/run` - Execute node & downstream cascade
- ✅ `/api/nodes/[id]/emit` - Manual emission (ChatNode)
- ✅ `/api/nodes/[id]/position` - Save canvas coordinates
- ✅ `/api/edges` - Edge creation/deletion
- ✅ `/api/edges/[sourceId]/[edgeId]` - Edge updates (varName)
- ✅ `/api/groups/[groupId]/subgraph` - Group interior view
- ✅ `/api/schemas/[type]` - Schema retrieval
- ✅ `/api/node-types` - Available node type list
- ✅ `/api/system/settings` - Global config (API keys)
- ✅ `/api/fs` - File browser for FileReaderNode

### 7. Testing & Quality
- ✅ Vitest unit tests: bufferStore, capabilityRegistry, queue, varMapping, scenarios, logHistory
- ✅ Playwright E2E tests: edge-drag-ui, edges-integrity, group-subgraph-edges, inspector-delete-guard
- ✅ Integration tests: Chat→LLM→Log pipeline, FileReaderNode actions
- ✅ All tests passing (106 tests, 8 skipped)

### 8. Documentation
- ✅ PBI backlog (31 items covering architecture, features, tests)
- ✅ Execution architecture docs (`lib/execution/docs/execution-v2.md`)
- ✅ Functional specification (`specification/functional specification.md`)
- ✅ Testing guide (`TESTING.md`)
- ✅ README with setup instructions

## Key Achievements

### Stability
- No critical bugs in core execution loop
- Atomic writes prevent data corruption
- Graceful handling of malformed JSON (warns & skips)
- Cycle detection prevents infinite loops
- Integrity guard repairs dangling edges on boot

### Performance
- Lazy schema compilation (cached after first use)
- Buffered input prevents redundant executions
- Temp file cleanup doesn't block API calls
- Position updates debounced to reduce disk I/O

### Developer Experience
- Hot reload works reliably
- Clear error messages with file paths
- Debug logging via console (dev mode)
- Schema validation feedback in UI
- Test coverage for critical paths

### User Experience
- Canvas drag & drop feels responsive
- LogNode auto-scrolls to latest entry
- Resize LogNode without data loss
- ChatNode → LLM → Log demo working end-to-end
- FileReaderNode action button triggers immediate execution

## Known Limitations (deferred to Phase 2+)

### Features Not Implemented
- [ ] Undo/redo (command pattern scaffolded but not wired)
- [ ] Snapshots (schema exists, no UI)
- [ ] Command console (no input widget)
- [ ] Logs panel (separate from LogNode)
- [ ] Real-time collaboration / websockets
- [ ] Node search / filtering
- [ ] Bulk operations (select multiple nodes)
- [ ] Export/import graph as JSON
- [ ] Execution replay / time-travel debugging
- [ ] Variable inspector (show all buffer states)
- [ ] Performance profiling (execution timing)

### Technical Debt
- [ ] LogNode history stored in node props (should be separate event log)
- [ ] ChatNode history duplicates (same issue)
- [ ] No pagination for large node lists
- [ ] Temp file accumulation (manual cleanup needed)
- [ ] No rate limiting on LLM calls
- [ ] Edge label rendering (varName not shown on canvas)
- [ ] Group proxy node positioning (hardcoded layout)
- [ ] No keyboard shortcuts (except Delete/Backspace/Escape)
- [ ] Inspector form doesn't validate on blur (only on submit)
- [ ] FileReaderNode directory scan can be slow (no progress indicator)

### Polish Items
- [ ] Inconsistent error toasts (some errors silent)
- [ ] LogNode resize handle hard to grab on small nodes
- [ ] No visual feedback when node execution starts
- [ ] Edge creation can be finicky (small hit targets)
- [ ] Group navigation breadcrumb would help orientation
- [ ] Settings panel doesn't show current values on open
- [ ] No dark mode toggle (hardcoded colors)
- [ ] Canvas zoom/pan could be smoother
- [ ] Node labels truncate without tooltip
- [ ] No confirmation dialog on destructive actions (except LogNode)

## Dependencies (frozen for Phase 1)

```json
{
  "next": "14.2.5",
  "react": "18.3.1",
  "reactflow": "11.10.3",

## Phase 2 Readiness

The codebase is now stable enough to:
- Add advanced execution features (conditional routing, loops, error handling)
- Build richer UI interactions (undo/redo, keyboard shortcuts, bulk ops)
- Introduce real-time collaboration (websockets, CRDT)
- Implement execution observability (timeline view, variable inspector, profiler)
- Explore plugin architecture for custom node types
- Add AI-assisted features (auto-layout, smart edge suggestions, prompt optimization)

---

## How to Run

**Development:**
```bash
cd apps/web
npm install
REPO_ROOT=../.. npm run dev
```

**Tests:**
```bash
npm test                  # unit tests
npm run test:e2e         # integration tests
```

**Production Build:**
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

---

## Team Notes

- Temp file cleanup can be done manually: `find nodes -name '*.json.tmp-*' -delete`
- LogNode resize fix applied (no longer shows stale history after resize)
- API logs are verbose in dev mode (helpful for debugging)
- Schema changes require server restart (no hot reload for schemas yet)
- Ollama model must be running locally for LLM demo to work

---

## Acknowledgments

Built with a focus on:
- **Simplicity** - File-based storage, no database complexity
- **Extensibility** - Schema-driven, middleware pipeline, capability registry
- **Testability** - Unit + E2E coverage, integration tests
- **Developer Joy** - Clear error messages, hot reload, inline diagnostics

Phase 1 represents a solid foundation for a visual graph execution engine. All core primitives are in place, battle-tested, and ready for advanced features.

**Next:** Phase 2 planning & prioritization.
